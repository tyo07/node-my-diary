# node-my-diary
Welcome to my first node js project.
I intend to make th is project as my pet project and actually wanted to create a diary project. 

This project should serve the API for the diary which you can do CRUD stuff

I wanted to use NoSQL as my backend because I have never really experience with it before.
My target of choice would be between Cassandra or Redis.
